## Vision
My goal is to make a fully functional and easy to understand Mashov API wrapper that works in  Python and in Node.js as 
there does not seem  to be any that are maintained or working propely.


## Python Wrapper
### Prequisistes
1) Have python installed on your machine
   if not see here https://www.python.org/downloads/
2) Have the requests library installed:
   `pip install requests`

### Development
Remember to make a config.py with your information


          mashov = {
                    "username": "yourusername",
                    "password": "yourpassword",
                    "semel": "yourschoolid",
                    "year": "2020",
                   }
1) Fork this repo
2) Add functions to wrapper.py
3) Make a pull request

### Deployment
Will self host wrapper on server or distribute to npm / pip
